CGI-UntaintPatched version 0.01
===============================

This module is exactly like CGI::Untaint except it contains a patch
for a bug or two that i wanted fixed.  I made every effort to work 
with the maintainer however he quit discussing it so I thought I would
release my own patch.  Initially, the bug fixed is the one introduced 
Dec. 2004 into CGI::Untaint that makes it not handle empty inputs 
the like it used to. See the Changes file for the list.
